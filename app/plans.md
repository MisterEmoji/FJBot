## new wanted folder structure (inside app folder):
- components (or modules, idk)
  - ...all components, eg. moderator, utility, etc.
    - index.js - file used to resolve component (decides whitch parts to load for given guild)
    - ...other moduler-related folders (eg. with commands)
- utils
  - ...all utils logically divided into separate files
- events
  - ...
- app.js
