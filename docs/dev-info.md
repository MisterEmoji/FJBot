## Applications
- created another discord application (Pub_FajnyBocik) to split public commands(etc.) into separate bot:
  - to run public bot instance use `node . public` or `node . pub` command (`node .` runs the private one).
  - you can similarly use `npm run deploy` with same argument logic as above.

## Folder Structure
- `docs` folder is intended to contain project-describing information
- `data` folder will contain all local bot-related data (for now there is only config and profile)
